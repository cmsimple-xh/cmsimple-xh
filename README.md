CMSimple_XH is a fast, small, easy-to-use and
easy-to-install modular Content Management
System (CMS), which doesn't need a database.

It is free Open Source Software under the
GPL3 Licence.

CMSimple_XH stores the content of the different
pages in one single html-file (content.htm).

As of CMSimple_XH 1.7 the pages are separated by special HTML comments in content.htm,
so H1-H6 can be used to structure each page.
