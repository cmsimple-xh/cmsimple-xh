Please DO NOT change the password directly in
config.php by using a text editor, because the
config.php only contains the encrypted password.
Change the default password right away after
login ONLINE !!!
(Login with default password "test")

This is the easiest and best working way.


For editing CMSimple_XH files it is essential
to USE ONLY editors, capable of detecting,
opening and saving files as "utf-8 without BOM"
(Byte Order Mark), like notepad++.

If this condition is not fulfilled, you will
damage your CMSimple installation.


If you have forgotten your password, you can
enter the encrypted password "test", i.e.:

\$P\$BHYRVbjeM5YAvnwX2AkXnyqjLhQAod1

via ftp into config.php and login using "test".

CMSimple_XH is a fast, small, easy-to-use and
easy-to-install modular Content Management
System (CMS), which doesn't need a database.

It is free Open Source Software under the
GPL3 Licence.

CMSimple_XH stores the content of the different
pages in one single html-file (content.htm).

In default setting headings H1-H3 are used
to split the content.htm into single pages
and to generate the navigation menu, while
headings H4-H6 remain for normal semantic
structuring within pages.
