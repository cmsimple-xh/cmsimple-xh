# JavaScript

[TOC]

CMSimple_XH is mainly developed in PHP. To improve the user
experience browser-side scripting is necessary; this is done
directly in the ECMAScript implementations of the browsers (i.e.
no precompiled language such as CoffeeScript or TypeScript is used).
This is documented in the separate
[JavaScript Documentation](../js/index.html).

# jQuery {#jquery}

Due to the fact that several major JavaScript frameworks may not be
compatible with each other and the popularity of
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) this is the only JavaScript
framework that is officially endorsed by CMSimple_XH. All
CMSimple_XH extension writers are advised to use
[jQuery4CMSimple](http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/extend:jquery4cmsimple),
if they want to use jQuery, jQueryUI and/or jQuery plugins.
