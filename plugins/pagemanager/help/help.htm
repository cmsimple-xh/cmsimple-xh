<h1>Pagemanager_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../pagemanager.png" style="float:left; margin-right:16px" alt="Plugin
Icon">
<p>Pagemanager_XH simplifies the administration of pages of a CMSimple_XH
installation. This plugin is comparable to the Menumanager plugin with regard to
functionality, but by using a treeview it allows for better handling of websites
with many pages. With Pagemanager_XH it is also possible to rearrange whole
submenus.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Pagemanager_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. Pagemanager_XH 2 requires
CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6. Additionally it requires the jQuery4CMSimple plugin, which
is already contained in the standard download of CMSimple_XH since 1.4.1.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory pagemanager/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
plugins/ directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories css/, config/ und
languages/.</li>
<li>Browse to Pagemanager's administration (Plugins &rarr; Pagemanager), and
check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select "Pagemanager" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Pagemanager_XH in "Config". Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Language". You can translate the character strings
to your own language, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Pagemanager_XH can be customized in "Stylesheet". Particularly,
you should look for the settings that are commented out. Maybe you like to try
them.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<img class="image-right" style="max-width: 100%" src="pagemanager.png"
alt="Pagemanager_XH screenshot">
<p>This plugin is used exclusively in CMSimple_XH's backend. It is started by
clicking "Pages" in the administration menu. Now you see a view of your site's
structure, that basically resembles the sitemap. However, it is possible to open
and close page branches in this view, so you don't loose overview of even
extensive websites. You can open or close those by clicking on the small markers
left to the page, or by double clicking their titles.</p>
<p>Above the tree view of your website's pages you find Pagemanager_XH's
<strong>toolbar</strong>. When hovering over the buttons, popups which describe
the tool's function will be shown. The two leftmost buttons allow to expand
resp. collapse the tree view of your website. The toolbar is particularly
useful, if your browser doesn't allow Pagemanager_XH's context menu to
popup.</p>
<p>Rearrangement of the structure of your pages is done by <strong>drag &
drop</strong>; when dragging according markers are shown, so you can see where
the page will be inserted when dropping it. If it is not possible to drag to a
certain page, because it would result in e.g. a recursive page structure, or the
nesting level would be greater then your configured "menu levels", this will be
shown by a red cross or you will simply be not allowed to drop there. <em>So
carefully watch the markers,</em> until you get a feeling how the drag&amp;drop
works. If you hold down the CTRL key while dragging, the result will be a copy
instead of a move operation.</p>
<table border="1" style="margin: auto">
<caption><strong>Examples of drag&amp;drop move operations</strong></caption>
<tr><th>during move</th><th>after move</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="move1.png" alt="Move 1"></td>
    <td><img src="result1.png" alt="Result 1"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="move2.png" alt="Move 2"></td>
    <td><img src="result2.png" alt="Result 2"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="move3.png" alt="Move 3"></td>
    <td><img src="result3.png" alt="Result 3"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="move4.png" alt="Move 4"></td>
    <td><img src="result4.png" alt="Result 4"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Additional functionality is available in the toolbar or through the
<strong>context menu</strong> (click the right mouse button on the page). You
can create new pages, rename or delete existing ones, and use the common
clipboard functions as an alternative to drag & drop. If a paste operation will
result in a recursive page structure, e.g. by copying a page into itself, it
will be silently ignored. <em>If you
delete the selected page, all it's subpages will be deleted as well.</em></p>
<p>The checkboxes to the left of the pages allow you to view and change their
<strong>publishing state</strong>. You can configure if they refer to
'Published?' or 'Show in menu?'. If this setting is empty (what is the default),
no checkboxes are shown. <strong>Duplicate headings</strong> are shown as in the
navigation menu. If you hover over them with the mouse pointer, the real page
headings will be displayed in a popup. <strong>Newly created pages</strong> will
be shown with a different icon, to better distinguish them from old pages.</p>
<p>The possiblitly to copy whole substructures might not seem resonable at first
sight, but it could be useful, e.g. if you've got a gallery on those pages,
because all content <em>and</em> meta data of these pages will be copied too. So
it is possible to adjust details afterwards.</p>
<p>Note that there is no undo or cancel functionality. If you've totally mixed
up your page structure simply refresh your browser's view <em>without</em>
saving before. Your old page structure will be presented again.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<h3>Irregular page structures</h3>
<p>It is possible that your existing website has an irregular page structure.
E.g. after an &lt;h1&gt; heading immediately follows an &lt;h3&gt; heading
without an &lt;h2&gt; heading in between. Such irregularities in your page
structure might have unintentionally been introduced while you were manually
editing the page structure in the editor (e.g. changing headings, deleting
pages), but it is possible that this feature is used by your system for a
special purpose.</p> <p>Anyway, Pagemanager can't handle such irregular page
structures, and if it detects it, it shows a message and offers you to fix it.
If the irregularity was introduced accidentially, you may safely confirm and go
on. Otherwise (or if you're not sure) take a backup of the contents file, before
you proceed, save the fixed structure from Pagemanager, and carefully check, if
everything still works as expected.</p>

<h3>jQuery</h3>
<p>Pagemanager_XH <em>may</em> not work in installations
with jQuery dependent plugins/addons/templates that
don't use jQuery4CMSimple, but import their own jQuery library.
This won't get fixed (as it's not possible to fix it in all cases),
because all developers are advised to use only jQuery4CMSimple together
with all their jQuery based code for CMSimple_XH.
So offending extensions should be updated!</p>
